### Added

- Added 12px font size to [theme](https://nulogy.design/theme/)
- Added a [Table](https://storybook.nulogy.design/?path=/story/table--table-with-data)
  - Currently in-development
    - Read-only so far

### Fixed

- `Select`'s `onChange` now returns an array of the values of the selected options.
  - Before, it used to return `undefined`. :(
  - Now, if the options are `[{label: "A", value: "a"}, {label: "B", value: "b"}]`, and you select both, `onChange` will return `["a", "b"]`

  ```

  - new:

  ```js

  ```

### Fixed

- Fixes a [navbar](https://nulogy.design/components/navbar/) flashing issue
  - When the screensize was for the "medium" navbar, it would initially
    flash the "small" navbar. Now it properly detects the window size to
    avoid the flashing.
- Sets the viewport as the container for components using `Popper.js`
  - `DropdownMenu`, `NavBarDropdown`, `IconicButton`, `Tooltips`
